- 👋 Hi, I’m @notrxig
- 👀 I’m interested in coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SQL, HTML... at the university so don't expect much from me 😅
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project or on any type of problem.
- 📫 You can reach me in DM (if there's any of this in here), if there isn't, just tag me 🫡
